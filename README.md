# FedSCCS: Hierarchical Clustering with Multiple Models for Federated Learning

Abstract â€” The rise of mobile devices and growing concernsabout model privacy have posed significant challenges in distributed artificial intelligence, especially due to the heterogeneityof devices, leading to model generalization and resource management issues. Federated Learning (FL), a method where machine learning models are trained collaboratively by sharing only local parameters with an aggregation server, faces challenges in model convergence, optimization, and communication overheaddue to this heterogeneity. This paper introduces FedSCCS, an FL-based framework designed for such heterogeneous settings. FedSCCS clusters devices based on the similarity of their models, allowing for efficient model aggregation and improved resource utilization. Our evaluation, set against established benchmarks,shows that FedSCCS achieves superior accuracy compared to existing methods, indicating a promising direction for scalableand tailored FL solutions.
